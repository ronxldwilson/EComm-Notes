# üß™ Mock Interview Q\&A: Shopify (PM Role)

---

### üü¢ **Section 1: Platform Understanding**

**Q1: What is Shopify, and why would a business choose it over alternatives like Magento or WooCommerce?**
**A1:** Shopify is a fully-hosted SaaS e-commerce platform designed for ease of use, fast deployment, and scalability for small to mid-sized businesses. A business would choose Shopify if they prioritize quick go-to-market, reduced technical overhead, and a rich third-party app ecosystem. It's ideal for D2C brands or MVPs. In contrast, Magento suits more complex, enterprise, or B2B use cases.

---

**Q2: What are the limitations of Shopify's customization capabilities?**
**A2:** The main limitations are:

* Checkout is locked down unless you're on Shopify Plus.
* Server-side code is not allowed ‚Äî all logic must run via APIs.
* Backend data models are opinionated and less flexible than open-source platforms.
* Multi-store setup is not natively supported ‚Äî requires workarounds via Shopify Markets or third-party apps.

---

### üü¢ **Section 2: Customer & Business Problem Solving**

**Q3: A client wants to support custom gift messages per product during checkout. How would you approach this in Shopify?**
**A3:** Shopify doesn‚Äôt natively support per-product notes at checkout. Workaround options include:

* Use **line item properties** (custom fields shown on product pages) to capture the message.
* Apps like **Infinite Options** can help render and store additional metadata.
* If the client is on Shopify Plus, we could customize checkout.liquid to improve UX.
* Ensure fulfillment staff can access the message in order details or packing slips.

---

**Q4: A merchant complains that their store is slow. What steps do you take?**
**A4:**

1. Audit theme: Check for excessive JavaScript, unoptimized images, or unused Liquid logic.
2. App review: Some apps add render-blocking scripts ‚Äî remove or defer non-essential ones.
3. Use **Shopify Analyzer** or **Google Lighthouse** to diagnose specific bottlenecks.
4. Recommend CDN optimization or lightweight themes.
5. If necessary, migrate to a headless architecture using **Hydrogen** for custom control.

---

### üü¢ **Section 3: Technical Fluency & Developer Collaboration**

**Q5: What is Liquid, and what role does it play in Shopify development?**
**A5:** Liquid is Shopify‚Äôs templating language used to build dynamic content within themes. It allows developers to loop through products, show conditional content, and render metafields. PMs should understand its basic structure to scope feasibility, estimate delivery time, and understand design constraints.

---

**Q6: How would you scope a project to build a custom Shopify app for a subscription product?**
**A6:**

* Define scope: Billing model, payment gateway support, subscription flexibility (skip/pause).
* Identify APIs: Shopify Billing API, Product API, Webhooks (order created, subscription renewed).
* Choose architecture: Embedded Shopify app (App Bridge + Polaris UI).
* Timeline: UI build, backend server setup, webhook testing, app approval (if public).
* QA plan: Test subscription flows, failed payments, cancellation edge cases.

---

### üü¢ **Section 4: Strategic & Product Thinking**

**Q7: When should a company consider moving from Shopify to Shopify Plus?**
**A7:** Indicators include:

* Need for **custom checkout** logic (e.g., loyalty integration, B2B pricing).
* **High volume sales** ‚Äî Plus offers better API limits and support.
* Desire to use **Shopify Flow**, Launchpad, or **B2B features**.
* Complex **multi-region support** (Markets + multiple stores).

---

**Q8: How would you enable a brand to expand globally on Shopify?**
**A8:**

* Use **Shopify Markets** for multi-currency and multi-language support.
* Set up **international domains/subfolders** per region.
* Enable local shipping rates, taxes, and payment methods.
* Use **GeoIP redirection** or language/currency selectors in the theme.
* Plan for regional SEO, compliance (e.g., GDPR), and translated content.

---

### üü¢ **Section 5: Analytics & Growth**

**Q9: What KPIs would you track to evaluate Shopify store performance?**
**A9:**

* Conversion Rate
* Average Order Value (AOV)

### üü¢ **Section 6: Bonus Curveballs**

**Q11: Your team wants to build a headless frontend. What are the pros/cons?**
**A11:**

| Pros                                       | Cons                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Full control over UX                       | More dev complexity |
| Use modern JS frameworks (React)           | Higher cost         |
| Better performance (if optimized)          | SEO setup is harder |
| Integrate with non-Shopify services easily | Longer dev time     |

Use **Hydrogen (React)** and host via **Oxygen** to simplify the stack.

**Q12: What would you do if a critical app (e.g., subscription engine) went down during BFCM?**
**A12:**

* Alert merchants and customers immediately via banners and email.
